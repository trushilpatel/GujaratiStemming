ઉબુન્ટુ is a Nguni Bantu term meaning "માનવતા". It is often translated as "I am because we are," and also "humanity towards others", but is often used in a more philosophical sense to mean "the belief in a universal bond of sharing that connects all humanity".
In દક્ષિણી આફ્રિકા, it has come to be used as a term for a kind of humanist philosophy, ethic, or ideology, also known as Ubuntuism propagated in the Africanisation process of these countries during the 1980s and 1990s.
Since the transition to democracy in દક્ષિણ આફ્રિકા with the નેલ્સન મંડેલા presidency in 1994, the term has become more widely known outside of Southern Africa, notably popularised to English-language readers through the ubuntu theology of Desmond Tutu. Tutu was the chairman of the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission, and many have argued that ubuntu was a formative influence on the TRC. However, this view is challenged and contextualized by Christian B. N. Gade in A Discourse on African Philosophy: A New Perspective on Ubuntu and Transitional Justice in South Africa. One of Gade's key findings is that former TRC commissioners and committee members question the importance of ઉબુન્ટુ in the TRC process. Another is that there are several differing and historically developing interpretations of ઉબુન્ટુ, some of which have evident political implications and reflect non-factual and creative uses of history.
