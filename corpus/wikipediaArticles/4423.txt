રાષ્ટ્રીય ધોરીમાર્ગ 3, commonly referred to as the Mumbai–Agra Highway or AB Road, is a major Indian National Highway that runs through the states of Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra in India.
The highway originates in Agra in Uttar Pradesh, generally travels southwest through Dhaulpur in Rajasthan, Morena, Gwalior, Shivpuri, Guna, Biaora, Maksi, Dewas and Indore in Madhya Pradesh, and Dhule, Nashik, Thane and terminates at Mumbai in Maharashtra. NH 3 runs for a distance of 1,190 km 
The stretch between Agra and Gwalior is marked as the North-South corridor by the National Highways Authority of India. In greater Mumbai area, the highway is also known as Eastern Express Highway which continues as Mumbai Nashik Expressway.
Currently, the stretch between Agra to Gwalior is four lane. The stretch from Gwalior via Shivpuri, Guna, Maksi up to Dewas road is not four lane. The condition between Shivpuri and Maksi is not good. Only patch work is done by NHAI. Now the tender for four lane along the same stretch is also done and work is going to start and may be completed up 2014. Even the stretch between Gwalior and Shivpuri is not great. However it can be done relatively easily.
Road from Dewas to Indore is currently being converted to six lane. Road from Indore to Mumbai is completely 4 lane but only problem is at Nasik city where the highway goes within the city and currently the elevated expressway of 25 km is being constructed which add to the problem.Stretch from Nashik to Mumbai is 4 lane Mumbai Nashik Expressway.
